# Sports-conflict
This Sports-conflict page is an application of game theory in sports events. The game here is modelled particularly on Kabaddi final which took place in 19th Asian games in Hangzhou, China. This application has a
normal form game which is rather simple but helps tha player to form startegies. Taking one-step further, extensive form game on the same scenario is modelled which introduces the concept of extensive form games 
alongwith adding a new layer to player strategies.
